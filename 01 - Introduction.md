# 01 - Introduction

- GitHub Actions were originally developed as a repository automation tool.
- GitHub realised key automation that most developers wanted was CI/CD in repo.
- They extended GA to support CI/CD workflows
- Still work-in-progress but there will be feature parity with Azure Pipelines in the near future
